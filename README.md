# Password-Generator

# This is a simple Java program for a password generator. It generates a random password with a specified length, containing a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. Additionally, it uses the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) to securely store and retrieve passwords in encrypted form.

# This program uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm for encryption. The generatePassword method generates a random password, and the encryptPassword method encrypts the generated password using the AES algorithm. The encryption key is generated using the generateEncryptionKey method. The program then prints both the generated password and the encrypted password for storage.

#Note: This is a simple example, and in a real-world scenario, you may want to consider additional security measures, such as storing the encryption key securely and using a secure password storage mechanism. Additionally, handling exceptions and errors appropriately is crucial for a production-level application.
